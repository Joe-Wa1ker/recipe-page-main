## My process

My process for this project was less structured than my process for future projects will be. I skimmed through the readme files and just got going, starting initially with a desktop first design. Realising that I could produce something better, I decided to start from scratch and spent some time looking into mobile first design. 

Even having restarted this project, I still think I could have put more time/effort into planning it out before I started writing code, but my initial step was to structure my HTML without adding any content. Once I was happy with the structure, I added in the image and text, doing this all in one go, when the structure was already there, made getting the content in much faster and I think it made my HTML structure better than it would have been, had I added the content as I built out the HTML. 

Once I was satisfied with how the page was looking unstyled, I started my CSS, working my way down the page in sections without moving on until I was happy with the section at hand. I still think the structure of my CSS could do with a lot of improvement, in terms of readability, grouping and brevity.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This was my first project so I learned a million things, but the biggest thing was to take a mobile first approach, and to use media queries. I thought getting the page to be responsive to different screen sizes would be really difficult and I was surprised at how easy the media queries made it.

### Continued development

I need to become better and more fluent with layout in general, I can get flexboxes and margin to work for me, but it takes a lot of tinkering and adjustment. Thinking in even more basic terms, I need to be better acquainted with the box model generally.

I should also spend more time planning out my code before I start writing it. 

I should note that whilst the page is mostly responsive (fine on mobile and most larger screens including desktop) I still had some trouble with the display across Asus Zenbook Fold, Surface Pro 7, iPad Pro, iPad air and iPad mini, on each of these devices you either couldn't see the bottom section of the page or couldn't see the margin below (containing whitespace) unless the devices were rotated. I tried a few different solutions including setting the HTML and body elements min-height and width to 100%, but I couldn't get anything to work.
